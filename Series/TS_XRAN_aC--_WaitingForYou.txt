	Msg2 <Urgent business calls me to \ELEMENT 3 ; count yourself lucky that I don't have time to remain here and call in reinforcements.>
	Msg2_1 <How strange... You're far deadlier than your reputation would have me expect. I'll have to rethink my strategy before fighting you again. In the meantime, I must be off to \ELEMENT 3 , and I recommend that you get some repairs.>
	CMsg2_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg2_2 <I must go immediately to \ELEMENT 3 . Don't think you've escaped, \PC ... I will return later to end your life once and for all.>
	CMsg2_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg2_3 <I can't stand losing! Meet me in \ELEMENT 3 for a rematch, if you dare.>
	CMsg2_3 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg2_4 <So, you have more life in you than I'd imagined... Business calls me to \ELEMENT 3 , but I assure you that I will return to finish what I've started.>
	CMsg2_4 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>
	Msg2_5 <If I had suspected you'd be so hard I would have brought my good mecha from \ELEMENT 3 . But no matter... Go repair your mek, \PC , since on my return I won't be holding back any longer!>
	CMsg2_5 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg2_6 <How is this possible!? There's no way someone like you could have defeated me! I have to go to \ELEMENT 3 , but I'll be back to have my revenge!>
	CMsg2_6 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg2_7 <I have been honorably defeated, and concede to you the field... Until we meet again in \ELEMENT 3 , \PC .>
	CMsg2_7 <ifChatNPCHeroic Accept>

	Msg3 <Just as I thought, you are pathetically weak. It's not worth my time to kill you. You're going to have to improve if you hope to face me again.>
	Msg3_1 <Hah, it's true what they say, you are pathetically weak. I'm afraid that you haven't been much of a challenge for me.>
	CMsg3_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg3_2 <You lose.>
	CMsg3_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg3_3 <I win again! How delightful.>
	CMsg3_3 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg3_4 <May death's door swallow you, \PC ...>
	CMsg3_4 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>
	Msg3_5 <Well, that was easy. Good-bye, \PC ...>
	CMsg3_5 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg3_6 <Is that the best you could do? It was hardly worth wasting my time on this fight...>
	CMsg3_6 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>

	Msg4 <I expected you to make it here eventually. Now, we will settle everything, with your death...>
	Msg4_1 <Did you get my email? It's about time for the two of us to settle things... Specifically, for me to stop you from ever interfering in my plans ever again. It's time to fight.>
	CMsg4_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg4_2 <I've been waiting. Let's finish this.>
	CMsg4_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg4_3 <I knew this was going to be a good day when I got out of bed this morning. Here I am, about to kill \PC ...>
	CMsg4_3 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg4_4 <I have accepted your existence for as long as possible. Now, it is time to snuff out your brief candle...>
	CMsg4_4 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>
	Msg4_5 <You're a thorn in my side that I just can't ignore any longer, \PC . It's time that thorn was picked out and cast aside for good.>
	CMsg4_5 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg4_6 <At last you've finally decided to show up... Now, we will see which one of us is the better pilot!>
	CMsg4_6 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg4_7 <Let us settle our differences in an honorable duel. The first one to die, loses.>
	CMsg4_7 <ifChatNPCHeroic Accept>

	Msg5 <Prepare to die!>
	Msg5_1 <You have no better speech than that? It's going to make a sorry epitath for your tombstone, I'll tell you that much...>
	CMsg5_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg5_2 <I already have.>
	CMsg5_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg5_3 <Show me what you've got!>
	CMsg5_3 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg5_4 <You will not leave this place alive.>
	CMsg5_4 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>
	Msg5_5 <Let's try to finish this quickly... I'm meeting someone for dinner.>
	CMsg5_5 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg5_6 <Try to show a bit more excitement, please... After all, today is the last day of your life!>
	CMsg5_6 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>

	Msg6 <You're spirited... that's good. It would be terrible to have to face a boring enemy. Let's begin this dance!>
	Msg6_1 <Ah, as eloquent a speech as I could expect from someone with your obvious intelligence. I'll be sure that they write that on your tombstone.>
	CMsg6_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg6_2 <Brave words, coming from someone who is soon to be dead.>
	CMsg6_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg6_3 <This is going to be such fun!>
	CMsg6_3 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg6_4 <You boast now, but later on you'll only bleed.>
	CMsg6_4 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>
	Msg6_5 <You seem very excited to face your own death. Far be it from me to deny it to you...>
	CMsg6_5 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg6_6 <That's just the answer I was hoping for. Let's begin our duel!>
	CMsg6_6 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>

	Msg7 <No condition to fight? You are pathetic. It's beneath my dignity to kill you now... Maybe someday we can meet again if you prove yourself worthy.>
	Msg7_1 <How pathetic. Once everyone finds out how you pleaded with me today, your reputation will be shot.>
	CMsg7_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg7_2 <Ah, in that case, I should attend to my more important business elsewhere...>
	CMsg7_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg7_3 <If you're not going to put up a good fight then it's not going to be any fun. We'll meet again, someday...>
	CMsg7_3 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg7_4 <So, you're too afraid to face me? Can't say I blame you. Run away, little dog... We'll meet again someday, and on that occasion I will kill you.>
	CMsg7_4 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>
	Msg7_5 <So you want to reschedule? Fine. I can kill you some other time.>
	CMsg7_5 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg7_6 <You're just making excuses! I knew that you wouldn't have the stomach to face me.>
	CMsg7_6 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg7_7 <In that case, I cannot in good conscience fight you. We will continue the duel at another time.>
	CMsg7_7 <ifChatNPCHeroic Accept>

	Msg8 <You defeated \ELEMENT 2 in a duel outside \ELEMENT 1 .>
	Msg9 <You were defeated by \ELEMENT 2 in a duel outside \ELEMENT 1 .>

	Prompt1 <Alright, let's begin.>
	Prompt1_1 <We might as well get started.>
	Prompt2 <You will die if you face me here today.>
	Prompt2_1 <I'm ready to destroy you, \ELEMENT 2 .>
	Prompt3 <I'm in no condition to fight.>
	Prompt3_1 <Not today, I'm not ready...>
