	Msg1 <Don't think that you've won today. You've merely prolonged the inevitable. Come face me aqain in \ELEMENT 3 ... next time, it is I who will be victorious!>
	Msg1_1 <You think you've got the better of me, but you haven't... As long as I live I will continue to hunt you down wherever you may be! Let's have a rematch in \ELEMENT 3 ... next time, it's I who will win!>
	CMsg1_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg1_2 <Sleep with one eye open, \PC . I'll see you again in \ELEMENT 3 .>
	CMsg1_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg1_3 <Ah, so it seems you got lucky today. That luck will run out eventually. Meet me in \ELEMENT 3 for a rematch... This time I won't hold back!>
	CMsg1_3 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg1_4 <You merely delay the inevitable march of death, \PC ... Let's meet again in \ELEMENT 3 and finish this.>
	CMsg1_4 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>
	Msg1_5 <So this time you win. Very well... next time I will, and you can expect no mercy. Meet me in \ELEMENT 3 for a rematch if you're brave enough.>
	CMsg1_5 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg1_6 <Your powers are formidible... But you are nothing to me, and I will crush you in time! I demand a rematch, in \ELEMENT 3 ! Meet me if you dare!>
	CMsg1_6 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg1_7 <An honorable duel, \PC ... You have bested me today. I demand a rematch... what say, in \ELEMENT 3 ? I know you won't be able to resist...>
	CMsg1_7 <ifChatNPCLawful Accept>
	Msg2 <You defeated \ELEMENT 2 outside of \ELEMENT 1 .>

	Msg5 <You are lucky to have escaped us today. That luck will soon run out, I assure you. Until the next time we meet...>
	Msg5_1 <Now that you've been humiliated, I hope you will tell everyone what an incredible pilot \ELEMENT 2 is. I'm sure you'll come back to challenge me again but I assure you it will be equally pointless.>
	CMsg5_1 <ifChatNPCSociable ifPCOK Accept>
	Msg5_2 <You lose.>
	CMsg5_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg5_3 <I win! I will have to toast a drink to your crushing defeat, \PC .>
	CMsg5_3 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg5_4 <How unfortunate, it was my intention to kill you today... When I see you again, I will do just that.>
	CMsg5_4 <ifChatNPCMelancholy IfPCOK Accept>
	Msg5_5 <So, this time I win... but you have escaped from the field of battle. I could hunt you down but it's not worth getting worked up over such small things. Until the next time we meet...>
	CMsg5_5 <ifChatNPCEasygoing IfPCOK Accept>
	Msg5_6 <You are no match for me, wangtta. Next time I see you I'll end your worthless life.>
	CMsg5_6 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg5_7 <You fought honorably, but your skills have been found wanting. Next time I will deliver the killing blow.>
	CMsg5_7 <ifChatNPCLawful Accept>

	Msg6 <You were defeated by \ELEMENT 2 outside of \ELEMENT 1 .>
	Msg7 <I've been waiting for you to show yourself. Now, we will battle!>
	Msg7_1 <It's so good that you've decided to join us. I've prepared a small party for you... Now, it's time for you to go down!>
	CMsg7_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg7_2 <I've been waiting. It's time for you to die.>
	CMsg7_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>

	CMsg7_3 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg7_4 <Death is waiting for you, \PC , and I am her messenger. You can try to run but I will only find you again.>
	CMsg7_4 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>
	Msg7_5 <What luck! Imagine finding you here... why, \PC , you're making the job of killing you trivially easy. Not that I'm complaining, mind you... Let's get this over with.>
	CMsg7_5 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg7_6 <Prepare yourself! We are about to do battle, a battle which only one of us can walk away from!>
	CMsg7_6 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg7_7 <\PC , you are hereby challenged to a duel, to take place right here and right now. If you dishonor me by refusing I will have no choice but to kill you.>

	Msg7_8 <I'll bet you weren't expecting this! Welcome to my ambush, \PC .>
	CMsg7_8 <ifChatNPCChaotic Accept>

	Msg8 <You're going down...>
	Msg8_1 <Don't worry. After you're dead I'll be sure to tell everyone that you fought valliantly.>
	CMsg8_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg8_2 <Let's begin.>
	CMsg8_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg8_3 <Let's see if it's true that you fight like a cow!>
	CMsg8_3 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg8_4 <You will die in pain...>
	CMsg8_4 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>
	Msg8_5 <I won't even have to break a sweat to defeat you.>
	CMsg8_5 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg8_6 <I hope you prove to be an adequate test of my skills. Otherwise, this entire fight will just be boring.>
	CMsg8_6 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg8_7 <May the better pilot win...>
	CMsg8_7 <ifChatNPCLawful Accept>
	Msg8_8 <No rules, no holds barred... only one survivor.>

	Msg8_13 <You could've been on the winning side, \PC , but you decided to betray us...>
	CMsg8_13 <if= XRB NAV_XRBExMember Accept>

	Msg9 <I am a force you should not take so lightly!!!>
	Msg9_3 <Ah, it's good to see that I will be facing someone with at least a modicun of wit.>
	CMsg9_3 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg9_4 <If you fight as well as you insult, this should be an easy fight for me...>
	CMsg9_4 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>

	Msg10 <Imagine seeing you here. So long as we are both in town there is no reason why we should not be civil. Once we leave here, though, we will be enemies again.>
	Msg10_2 <Eh, you!? Look, we're in town. We can't start anything here.>
	CMsg10_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg10_4 <Just what I need, to ruin my day off... What do you want, \PC !?>
	CMsg10_4 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>
	Msg10_7 <I certainly hope that you're not looking for trouble. The guards around here wouldn't react kindly if you started a fight... Surely we're civilized enough to wait until later to begin our duel.>
	CMsg10_7 <ifChatNPCLawful Accept>
	Msg10_8 <Well, if it isn't \PC . Count yourself lucky that we're in town, otherwise I'd snuff out your worthless life in an instant.>
	CMsg10_8 <ifChatNPCChaotic Accept>
	Msg10_10 <Hello \PC . It's a shame what happened to your parents. I wouldn't worry; you'll be joining them soon enough...>
	CMsg10_10 <if= XRB NAV_XRBFamilyDied Accept>
	Msg10_11 <When you were a member of \NARRATIVE 2 , I used to look up to you. Now I see what a failure you've become... If we weren't in town right now, I'd send you to your grave.>
	CMsg10_11 <if= XRB NAV_XRBExMember ifFaction N2 Accept>
	Msg10_12 <Ah, \PC . We were all surprised to learn that you were still alive... though greatly relieved that your memories are gone. Are you still searching for your lost life? It seems that some day I'll have to finish the job I started...>
	CMsg10_12 <if= XRM NAV_XRMAmnesia Accept>
	Msg10_13 <So the clues have led you here as well? Don't waste your time... I have already determined that there is nothing in \ELEMENT 1 to interest either of us.>
	CMsg10_13 <if= XRM NAV_XRMItem Accept>


	Msg15 <You haven't figured that out on your own yet? You must be stupider than you look. Perhaps they are wrong... perhaps you're not as much of a danger as they say.>
	Msg15_1 <I'd love to explain everything to you but my masters have asked that I not get personally involved with the quarry.>
	CMsg15_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg15_2 <Don't ask questions you don't really want answered.>
	CMsg15_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg15_8 <Ah, but that would be telling... You can't expect me to hand you everything on a silver platter, can you?>
	CMsg15_8 <ifChatNPCChaotic Accept>
	Msg15_9 <You honestly can't remember a thing? If I could trust in that, it would be merciful to let you live... but if your memories ever return, you could be a danger to the project. So you must be eliminated.>
	CMsg15_9 <if= XRM NAV_XRMAmnesia Accept>
	Msg15_10 <You are the continuation of a remarkable bloodline, \PC ; a bloodline that must be eliminated if we are to immanentize the eschaton. Nothing more need be said.>
	CMsg15_10 <if= XRM NAV_XRMFamilySecret Accept>
	Msg15_11 <You appear to be seeking the same item as my masters. We obviously cannot afford to have someone else discover it first. If the only way to stop you is to kill you, then that is what must be done.>
	CMsg15_11 <if= XRM NAV_XRMItem Accept>
	Msg15_12 <We're on opposite sides of the great conflict. Like two mad dogs, there's nothing left for us but to fight, and in the end only one will survive.>
	CMsg15_12 <if= XRB NAV_XRBSeekingRevenge Accept>
	Msg15_13 <Because you are a traitor to our order! You must be killed, to serve as an example... The time of the eschaton is nearly upon us, and we can afford no complications.>
	CMsg15_13 <if= XRB NAV_XRBExMember Accept>

	Msg16 <In the middle of \ELEMENT 1 ? You must be daft. Aside from the obvious problems of bystanders and the Guardians, there's also my reputation to think about.>
	Msg16_1 <That's not going to happen. There's too many bystanders, and guards who would probably interfere. Plus, what would people say about me if I behaved like a common rougheon? No, when we fight, it will be at a time and place of my choosing.>
	CMsg16_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg16_2 <No. This is no place for a fight. We will continue this discussion later.>
	CMsg16_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg16_3 <Are you completely bonkers? Start a fight in the middle of \ELEMENT 1 ? Look, we'll fight later, but not here.>
	CMsg16_3 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg16_4 <This isn't the place for that, idiot. Too many people around to interfere. No, we will not fight here, but rest assured that your death approaches...>
	CMsg16_4 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>
	Msg16_5 <I don't want to fight you now. I've got other things to do. If you want, I promise that I'll come back to fight you later...>
	CMsg16_5 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg16_6 <It's taking every bit of self control I have to not run you through where you stand. But, there are things that just aren't done... I will kill you later, when we are both beyond the walls of civilization.>
	CMsg16_6 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg16_7 <Fight here in the middle of town? Are you a barbarian? That's not something a civilized warrior would even consider. There are too many bystanders who could get hurt...>
	CMsg16_7 <ifChatNPCLawful Accept>
	Msg16_8 <Eh, I'd rather not. I'll be seeing you again, sometime when I hold the advantage...>
	CMsg16_8 <ifChatNPCChaotic Accept>

	Msg17 <Then why did you speak with me? If you have nothing to say, then don't disturb me.>
	Msg17_2 <Then go away.>
	CMsg17_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg17_3 <Ah, so that's why you're the one who came up to me. I understand now. Idiot.>
	CMsg17_3 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg17_4 <Excuse me, you're the one who started this conversation. Idiot.>
	CMsg17_4 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>
	Msg17_9 <You have nothing to say, but maybe you're hoping that I do... You are hunting for any small clue to the secret of your past. Well, perhaps I will tell you who you are, right before I end your life...>
	CMsg17_9 <if= XRM NAV_XRMAmnesia Accept>

	Msg18 <What? You mean, you don't recognize me? How could you forget so easily... Think harder, back to middle school...>
	Msg19 <Then you'll also remember how I swore my eternal revenge on you, for winning the heart of the one who should have been mine! I have nothing more to say to you, except that you still aren't forgiven...>
	Msg20 <I wonder if you remember anything else, then... remember how you stole the love of the one who should have been mine, and how on that day I swore my eternal revenge!>
	Msg21 <\ELEMENT 2 hates you because of a love triangle from middle school.>
	Msg22 <Don't try to make lightly of other people's emotions! I have been waiting for my revenge; since you stole my love away it's all I've had to live for.>
	Msg23 <You're saying that my one true love who chose you over me means nothing to you!? How callous! You will pay dearly for your insensitivity!!!>
	Msg24 <I knew it! So that means you still remember, and you hate me as much as I hate you... You do still remember, don't you? Think hard... all the way back to middle school... You couldn't have forgotten that so easily...>
